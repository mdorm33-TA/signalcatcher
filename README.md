## What Is Signal Catcher?

Signal Catcher takes raw OHLCV (Open/High/Low/Close/Volume) price and volume data and collapses it into a single **Weighted Technical Score** from 0–100 for any ticker you type in.

No AI inside the scoring engine. No subjective chart drawings. No fundamentals in the math. Just clean, deterministic computation that two independent implementations will always agree on — the same data always produces the same score.

> **Cross-AI Validated:** The indicator computations and scoring logic were independently audited by running them through Grok, Claude, and Gemini to verify the scoring engine's mathematical accuracy. The weighting system, confluence definitions, and conflict pairs also incorporate the best recommendations from all three AI platforms — each contributed ideas that made the final architecture stronger than any single perspective would have produced.

It runs two ways:

- **Instant web tool** — single-page HTML (zero install) for interactive analysis of any ticker. Open it, type a symbol, get charts and a score in seconds.
- **Automated email alerts** — a Cloudflare Worker scans a symbol watchlist twice daily (10:15 AM and 4:20 PM ET) and emails you only when high-conviction patterns survive every quality gate.

## Why Add Technical Analysis to Your Fundamental Work?

You already do the hard work on fundamentals: earnings quality, competitive moat, valuation, growth runway. That answers the **"what"** — is this a business worth owning?

Technical analysis answers the **"when"** — is the price action confirming or fighting your thesis *right now*?

Even the best company can hand you a painful 20–30% drawdown if you buy at the wrong moment of a trend. You pull up the chart and it's a wall of colored lines, bands, clouds, and crossovers — each saying something valid, but not saying the same thing. The interpretation is where emotion and second-guessing creep in.

That's the problem Signal Catcher solves. It takes the visual noise of a chart and quantifies it into one number. Not a guess — a repeatable mathematical synthesis of everything the chart is actually saying.

**Fundamentals → conviction in the name.**
**Technicals → conviction in the timing.**

Together, they help you avoid the classic "great company, terrible entry" trap.

## The Core Idea: Two Families of Indicators

Every market speaks in two voices at once:

| Family | What It Measures | Indicators | Best In |
|--------|-----------------|------------|---------|
| **Trend-Following** | Persistence & strength of the current move | SMA (Simple Moving Average) 200, MA (Moving Average) Cross 50/200, Ichimoku Cloud | Strong directional markets |
| **Contrarian** | When a move has gone too far (exhaustion) | RSI (Relative Strength Index) Extreme, DeMark Sequential, Bollinger Bands, MFI (Money Flow Index) | Turning points & reversals |

Most systems try to smooth away the disagreement between these families. Signal Catcher does the opposite:

- **When both families agree** → highest-conviction setup. The trend is strong AND it's not exhausted.
- **When they clash** → the system flags the exact tension, because those moments often mark transitions where the biggest opportunities — and the biggest risks — tend to hide.

This isn't noise to be eliminated. It's the signal.

## How the Scoring Works

### 1. Score Each Indicator (0–100)

Ten carefully selected indicators — each chosen because it provides unique information no other indicator covers — independently score the current market condition. Contrarian indicators use inverted scoring: oversold RSI is scored bullish because sellers are exhausted.

### 2. Weight by Confidence Bucket

| Bucket | Weight | Indicators | Role |
|--------|--------|-----------|------|
| **HIGH** | 60% | Volume Profile, SMA 200, MA Cross 50/200, RSI Extreme, OBV (On-Balance Volume) | Structural, institutional-grade signals — the big-picture anchors |
| **MED** | 40% | Money Flow Index, Ichimoku Cloud, Bollinger Bands, DeMark Sequential, Candlestick Signal | Interpretive timing tools that refine the picture |

Each indicator also has an **intra-weight** reflecting its individual authority. SMA 200 carries the highest (1.4×) because it's the single most widely watched level by institutional investors globally. RSI Extreme carries the second-highest (1.2×) because it sits at the opposite end of the philosophical spectrum — the strongest contrarian signal paired with the strongest trend signal.

### 3. Apply the ADX Regime Overlay

The Average Directional Index doesn't contribute a score. Instead, it acts as a **market regime switch** that dynamically adjusts trend-follower weights:

| ADX Reading | Regime | Multiplier |
|-------------|--------|------------|
| ≥ 40 | Very Strong Trend | 1.20× boost |
| ≥ 30 | Strong Trend | 1.12× boost |
| ≥ 25 | Trending | 1.06× boost |
| 20–25 | Transitional | 1.00× (neutral) |
| < 20 | Choppy | 0.85× dampen |

No more trusting directional calls in a range-bound market.

### 4. Detect Confluences & Conflicts

**7 confluence patterns** boost indicator weights when specific combinations align:

| Pattern | Indicators | Multiplier | What It Means |
|---------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| 🔒 Triple Trend Confirmed | SMA 200 + Ichimoku + MA Cross | 1.12× | All three trend systems agree — "stay in the trade" |
| 🔥 Triple Exhaustion Reversal | RSI + DeMark + Bollinger | 1.15× | Three exhaustion measures firing — highest alpha signal |
| ⚡ Double Exhaustion | DeMark + Bollinger | 1.10× | Two-indicator reversal timing |
| 📈 Dual Oscillator | MFI + RSI | 1.08× | Volume-weighted and price-only momentum aligned |
| 🏦 Volume Confirms Trend | OBV + SMA 200 | 1.08× | Smart money flowing with the trend |
| 💪 Smart Money Signal | OBV + MFI | 1.10× | Both volume measures tell the same story |
| 🏗 Structure + Trend | Volume Profile + SMA 200 | 1.06× | Institutional levels + trend direction |

**8 conflict pairs** surface meaningful disagreements (triggered when two indicators diverge by 40+ points):

| Conflict | What It Means |
|----------|---------------|
| SMA 200 vs. RSI Extreme | Classic trend vs. exhaustion tension — the philosophical backbone of the system |
| Ichimoku vs. MFI | Trend direction and volume-weighted momentum disagree |
| OBV vs. Bollinger | Institutional money tells a different story than price bands |
| DeMark vs. SMA 200 | Exhaustion says reverse; trend says continue |
| MFI vs. RSI | Volume-weighted vs. price-only momentum diverge |
| MA Cross vs. Ichimoku | Two trend systems disagree — transition in progress |
| OBV vs. SMA 200 | Volume flow diverging from price trend — early warning |
| MFI vs. OBV | Short-term volume impulse vs. long-term volume trend |

### 5. Specialized Alert Patterns

**Falling Knife** — four simultaneous conditions (RSI oversold + DeMark buy + bearish candlestick + confirmed downtrend) detect potential capitulation bottoms.

**Blow-Off Top** — the mirror image, detecting euphoria tops where exhaustion meets a confirmed uptrend.

### The Result

One composite **Weighted Technical Score** (0–100), classified as Strongly Bullish → Neutral → Strongly Bearish, with full transparency into every indicator's reading, every active confluence, every conflict, and the current market regime.

## What You Can Do With It

### For a Fundamental Investor

You don't have to abandon anything you already do. Think of Signal Catcher as adding a disciplined second opinion from someone who only looks at the price tape:

- **Avoid buying into exhaustion** — A score of 28 with Triple Exhaustion active means the technicals are begging you to wait, even if the fundamentals look perfect.
- **Confirm your entry** — A score of 72 with Triple Trend Confirmed and volume flowing in means the chart agrees with your thesis. That's when the odds shift.
- **Recognize transitions** — When trend and exhaustion indicators are fighting, the market is changing. Signal Catcher surfaces these moments instead of hiding them.
- **Stay in strong moves** — When trend is aligned, exhaustion is absent, and OBV confirms accumulation, that's a "stay in the trade" environment.

A strong technical score on a weak business is still a bad investment. But a strong fundamental thesis combined with a favorable technical setup — that's a trade where the odds are genuinely in your favor.
